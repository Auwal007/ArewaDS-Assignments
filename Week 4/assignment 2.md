# Apply your skills

## Instructions

So far, you have worked with the [sMinnesota birds dataset to discover information about bird quantities and population density](https://github.com/arewadataScience/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning/blob/main/3-Data-Visualization/06-visualization-distributions/README.md). Practice your application of these techniques by trying a different dataset, perhaps sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Build a notebook to tell a story about this dataset, and make sure to use histograms when discussing it.
